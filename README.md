# europa-inrealis

When playing the world's best game, Europa Universalis IV, I want to have a challenging experience, not a historically accurate one. 
That means I don't want the United Kingdom to stick to their isles - I want them to conquer France! 
That means I don't want Spain to leave pitiful Portugal alone - conquer, conquer, conquer! 
That means that Ming should represent a mounting threat, slowly creaping from East Asia to Western Europe.

As things stand now, the AI does act more the way I want it to. Unfortunetly, there are several problems, some tractable and some not.

Nearly all 'fixes' are made more by tweaking global variables than by changing AI programming. For example, expansion is encouraged by making it
nearly cost free to manufacture a CB. 

Another problem is that the AI will still leave alone some easy conquests. Another is that the AI will often give up on 'important wars' and double down on 'unimportant ones'.

And the hardest problem - the AI is still really stupid. The only way to approximate the behavior I want is by beefing up bonuses to all AI,
and beefing up the bonuses to lucky nations.
